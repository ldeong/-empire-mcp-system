### Development / Restart Codespace

The MCP system includes a comprehensive Codespaces helper system with self-healing capabilities for development environments.

#### Prerequisites
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Required for container restart functionality
- **Node.js 18+**: For running MCP server and helper scripts
- **npm**: For dependency management

#### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Complete development cycle with health checks and auto-recovery
node scripts/dev-helper.js run

# Start continuous health monitoring
node scripts/dev-helper.js monitor

# Manual health check
node scripts/dev-helper.js health

# Get detailed system status
node scripts/dev-helper.js status

# Restart entire Codespace environment
./scripts/restart-codespace.sh

# Skip container restart (faster for development)
./scripts/restart-codespace.sh --skip-container
```

#### Available Scripts

**`scripts/restart-codespace.sh`** (Executable)
- Stops any running MCP dev server processes
- Restarts Codespace container using GitHub CLI
- Performs clean dependency installation (`npm install`)
- Starts MCP server automatically via `mcp-control.js`
- Runs health checks on `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Comprehensive error handling and logging to `restart-codespace.log`

**`scripts/mcp-control.js`** (Node.js)
- Graceful integration with `mcp-ecosystem-manager.js` when available
- Fallback to `npm start` or `node server.js` if manager unavailable
- Process management for MCP server lifecycle
- Detailed logging to `dev-helper.log`

**`scripts/dev-helper.js`** (Node.js)
- Automated health checks with configurable retries and intervals
- Self-healing agent with exponential backoff recovery
- Runs complete development cycle: install ‚Üí start ‚Üí test ‚Üí verify
- Automatic restart attempts on health/test failures
- Continuous monitoring mode for long-running development

#### Development Helper Options

```bash
# Customize retry behavior
node scripts/dev-helper.js run --max-retries 5 --health-interval 60000

# Use different server URL
node scripts/dev-helper.js health --server-url http://localhost:8080

# Install dependencies only
node scripts/dev-helper.js install
```

#### Self-Healing Features

The development helper system includes:
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent retry delays to avoid overwhelming failed services
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous checks of `/health` endpoint with configurable intervals
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic dependency reinstall and server restart on failures
- **Test Integration**: Runs `test-mcp-ecosystem.js` and attempts recovery on test failures
- **Process Management**: Clean shutdown and restart of MCP server processes

#### Logging and Monitoring

All scripts provide comprehensive logging:
- **`restart-codespace.log`**: Complete restart process logs with timestamps
- **`dev-helper.log`**: Development cycle, health checks, and recovery attempts
- **Console Output**: Real-time status with color-coded messages

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start development session
./scripts/restart-codespace.sh

# 2. Run continuous monitoring (in background)
node scripts/dev-helper.js monitor &

# 3. Develop your features...

# 4. Run health check before committing
node scripts/dev-helper.js health

# 5. If issues arise, trigger recovery
node scripts/dev-helper.js run
```

#### Integration with CI/CD

The helper scripts are designed to be compatible with:
- **GitHub Actions**: Use in workflow steps for environment setup
- **Docker**: Scripts work in containerized environments
- **MCP Resilience**: Integrates with existing MCP ecosystem patterns

#### Suggested Improvements

**Dockerization Enhancements:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds for development and production
- Docker Compose setup for local development with dependencies
- Health check integration in Docker containers

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
- Automated Codespace setup workflows
- Self-healing CI/CD pipelines with retry logic
- Integration tests using the dev-helper system
- Automatic environment recovery on workflow failures

**Agent-Ready Architecture:**
- Webhook endpoints for external monitoring systems
- Metrics export for observability platforms
- API endpoints for remote health checks and recovery triggers
- Integration with GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency updates

## üîí Security
